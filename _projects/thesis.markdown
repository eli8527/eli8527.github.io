title:  "thesis project"
---
each year, thousands of princeton students publish senior theses, many of which are never read.

in a joint collaboration with the office of undergraduate research at princeton and [princeton innovation](http://princetoninnovation.org/), i am leading a thesis discovery project. this web app allows for students to discover theses published by previous students of the university through a visual display of theses titles and topics.

currently in progress, the hope is that this project will allow students and all members of the community to discover the unique and amazing research that goes on at princeton. challenges include visualizing very text heavy data and providing a captivating experience for users. the hope is to use nlp and various algorithms to detect keywords and generate abstracts for easier consumption.

#### design considerations
though we are still in our early stages, there are several design considerations that we have to take into account. a key one is how we present the theses, both individually and as a whole. when selecting theses to show to users, we wanted to make sure that they would be interesting while still being unbiased. we settled on tagging all theses with several keywords and then displaying relevant ones based on trending keywords on twitter.
