Design Summer is a new program dedicated to creating a community for interns interested in design. I came up with this idea after realizing how much design exists on islands and how important it is for those interested in design to be able to connect with those in the industry.

With a team of three others, We are building a community of interns in the Bay Area who are interested  in learning, collaborating, and making an impact through design. To that end, we are bringing together about 300 of the brightest and most creative design-oriented interns in the Bay Area throughout the summer to share ideas and build relationships through city excursions & museum visits, weekly group dinners, hands-on design workshops, and speaker events.

Past and future events include:

1. a design talk with john maeda
2. company visit and workshop at facebook
3. company visit and dinner at airbnb
4. dinner meetup with designers from fjord design
5. company visit to indiegogo
6. typography workshops
7. ideo visit
