title: "poetry markov model"
---
in our introductory computer science class at princeton, one of the assignments was to create a markov model on a given text and then simulate a trajectory to generate text based off of the texts. i decided to build a scraper using [beautiful soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) in order to download poetry and then generate "poems" by several famous poets. below is the code, as well as a selection "by" walt whitman.
