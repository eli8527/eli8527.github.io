for the past year, i have been principally in change of all design for hackprinceton. here, i highlight the t-shirt designs that i did for hackprinceton fall 2014 and spring 2015.

#### fall 2014
the challenge about t-shirt design is the fact that its a completely different medium. for me, i wanted to explore it completely and create something memorable, distinctive, and most of all, unexpected from a hackathon shirt. 

i began by looking at preexisting shirts from a variety of hackathons. what i noticed was that many of them did a poor job of conveying the atmosphere and characteristics of their respective hackathon. indeed many of them were just the hackathon's logo.

i began by exploring a variety of directions. i knew that the organizers of the fall hackprinceton wanted to give it a fun and exploratory characteristic. so with that in mind, i began iterating.

* <img src="/images/hp/3.jpeg" alt="hp" width="150"/>
* <img src="/images/hp/4.jpeg" alt="hp" width="150"/>

the final design that i selected, which is a play off the very first one, was the one below. the reason why i chose it was because of the evocation of space and playfulness. each "planet" represented an idea, all orbiting around a central entity, hackprinceton. in the end, i felt as though it was the most effective at portraying hackprinceton's identity for fall 2014.

#### spring 2015
for spring 2015, the main theme was classy and relaxed. as a result, most of my designs explored some more muted designs that were less poppy compared to fall 2014's.

* <img src="/images/hp/s3.png" alt="hp" width="150"/>
* <img src="/images/hp/s4.png" alt="hp" width="150"/>

the final design that i settled seemed almost more like a fashion brand than anything. but its minimalist aesthetic helped to convey the theme rather well.
