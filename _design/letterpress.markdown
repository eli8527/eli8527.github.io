i became interested in letterpress after taking [vis215: typography](http://t-y-p-o-g-r-a-p-h-y.org/) with david reinfurt. i continued my interests in letterpress with [david sellers](http://www.piedoxen.com/) independently before formally starting a club in the fall of 2014 called [princeton university letterpress](http://www.princeton.edu/~putype).

letterpress interests me because of the minute level of detail required when designing a print. every design decision matters, from the layout to the ink to the paper. to me, letterpress and much of design has an analog with computer science. every line matters, but also everything as a whole also matters.
