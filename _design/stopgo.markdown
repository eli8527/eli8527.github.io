*create a stop and go sign without any of the traditional indications of stop and go.*

in my visual form class, we were tasked to design a stop and go sign with the above constraint, begining with the stop sign. i began by sketching fifty possibilities, before narrowing it down to the ten shown below.

from here, i selected option 9 and began iterating on it. 9 was the most effective as the arrow leading to the line conveyed a hard stop, whereas others were slightly harder to distinguish a meaning from. as you can see, i played with various weights and lengths before eventually moving away to a circle, which i decided was more appealing to the eye and could appear in more situations.
